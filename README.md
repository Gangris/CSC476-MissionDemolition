# EastmanHomework3

I worked on the initial project, and ran into multiple hangups. Between the hangups, and other class's midterms, this homework suffered.

I worked on saving multiple lines, but I could not get it to save correctly, and had issues where the line kept disappearing.

Castle creation was tedious, and prone to issues.

I also still cannot get webGL builds to work and display on taz.
